# Local .lvimrc

This plugin will start from the root folder of the filesystem and search up to
the current directory, sourcing any .lvimrc file it finds. This makes it easy to
have per-directory or per-project vim settings.

## Inspiration
I normally work with 4 spaces for tabs, however the current project I'm on uses
2 spaces for tabs. I know that there are plugins out there that do this already,
but I just wanted something that was simple and quick. This is only 16 lines.

## Usage with Vundle
```
Plugin 'pinktrink/localvimrc'
```

## Contributing
Sure, feel free to contribute. Just don't bloat it. It's fast, it's simple, and
it works. That's what I like.
